! Input file for readAQWAResults_SingleBody which is specific developed for extracting results from the LIS files generated by AQWA. 
! The positions, velocities and accelerations of the platform can be output based on the definitions below. The platform is a single body. It is capable of extracting the results of tower sections or nacelle that are defined in AQWA
