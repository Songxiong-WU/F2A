! Input file of the interface FAST2AQWA that is developed by Y.Yang (PDRA in LJMU) on 10-March-2020 for performing fully-coupled analysis of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs)
! The FAST2AQWA is implemented through the user_force DLL. FAST v7 is used to examine the aero-elastic effects of the wind turbine.
! This file is specified for NREL 5MW wind turbine supported by the OC3-Hywind platform (Do not remove anyline below)
