It may have a problem that some DLLs are missed when running the pre-compiled code (readAQWAResults_SingleFile.exe) to extract the results stored in *.LIS file generated by AQWA. 

Usually, you only need 4 DLLs: libifcoremd.dll, libifportmd.dll, libmmd.dll, svml_dispmd.dll. You will need to place the corresponding DLLs with the right version into the same directory of the executable file. The pre-compiled version of the result extraction code is 32-bit version. 

Alternatively, you can install an Intel Fortran compiler or redistributable to address the issue completely. You will not have the problem again if you can compile the code in your own computer.
